title: Imitation Learning
---

Imitation learning as the name suggests means copying something or someone, this is how we as a kid learnt making funny faces right?Whenever you as a kid faced an awkward situation or shortage of comebacks,it came in handy(atleast for me..yes!).But why did you use it,personally I did it because I saw other kids doing this and it looked kind of cool and my brain decided to copy the same frowning on the face and use it it similar situation.
It turns out to be that imitation is something which is an integral part of learning process,for e.g We all know the legend Michael Jackson who created a whole new dance form (genius), and many budding and professional dancers copy his move,because we all know if we copy his moves and somehow succeed in learning it,we will be a nicknamed Jackson which is an honour.
